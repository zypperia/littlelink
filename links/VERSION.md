# LittleLink Version History

## Current Version: v3.7.0

### v3.7.0 - 4/18/2025
- Added [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/).

### v3.6.0 - 3/25/2025
- Finally adds Docker support to LittleLink. See [PR #151](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink/pull/151), thank you [@lllahaye](https://github.com/lllahaye).
  - Docker support has been a long-standing community request. While I previously closed similar PRs in an effort to keep the LittleLink repo as minimal as possible, several community forks emerged that added Docker support independently. Over the last few weeks I had been reconsidering this stanceâ€”this PR arrived at just the right time.
- Updated the brand color for Signal.
